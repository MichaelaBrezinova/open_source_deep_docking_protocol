    "# Original Paper summary - *Deep Docking: A Deep Learning Platform for Augmentation of Structure Based Drug Discovery*\n",
    "- recent surge of\n",
    "small molecules availability presents great drug discovery\n",
    "opportunities, but also demands much faster screening protocols\n",
    "- there is still a global lack of experience in screening such libraries, and the advantage of docking them versus smaller collections is still matter of debate.6 However, few recently published works seem to advocate for expanding VS to ultralarge chemical libraries. \n",
    "- the current chemical space remains largely inaccessible to structure-based drug discovery - current approach to address this disparity is to filter large chemical collections to manageable drug-, lead-, fragment-, and hit-like subsets (among others) using precomputed physicochemical parameters and drug-like criteria, such as molecular weight, volume, octanol−water partition coefficient, polar surface area, number or rotatable bonds, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, among many others.\n",
    "- conventional docking workflow is remarkably neglectful of negative results and the vast majority of docking data (both favorable and, especially unfavorable) is not being utilized in any way or form, while it could represent a very relevant, well-formatted, and content-rich input for machine learning algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "- DD achieves up to 100-fold reduction of an ultralarge docking database and up to 6000-fold enrichment for the top-ranked hits, while avoiding significant loss of favorable virtual hits, as it will be discussed below.\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">DD pipeline: </font>\n",
    "    - For each entry of an ultralarge docking database (such as ZINC15), the standard set of ligand-based QSAR descriptors (such as molecular fingerprints) is computed;\n",
    "    - A reasonably sized training subset is randomly sampled from the database and docked into the target of interest using conventional docking protocol(s)\n",
    "    - The generated docking scores of the training compounds are then related to their 2D molecular descriptors through a DL model; a docking score cutoff (typically negative) is then used to divide training compounds in virtual hits (scoring below the cutoff) and nonhits (scoring above the cutoff) - deciding cutoff also gradually becomes more stringent over iterations\n",
    "    - The resulting QSAR deep model (trained on empirical docking scores) is then used to predict docking outcomes of yet unprocessed entries of the database. A predefined number of predicted virtual hits are then randomly sampled and used for the training set augmentation;\n",
    "    - Steps b−d are repeated iteratively until a predefined number of iterations is reached, and/or processed entries of an ultralarge docking database are converged\n",
    "- <font color=\"green\">Ultra Large Docking Database Sampling: </font>\n",
    "    - Selection of a representative and balanced training set is a critical step of any modeling workflow - a proper DD training set should effectively reflect database’s chemical diversity\n",
    "    - Biasing sampling toward molecules that are highly ranked by DD as potential virtual hits could exclude low ranked, yet true positive molecules from being selected for model training; therefore we selected random sampling for all DD iterations.\n",
    "    - To establish an optimal sampling of ZINC15 base, the relationship between the size of DD training set and the corresponding means and standard deviations of the test set recall values was evaluated\n",
    "- Size reduction by virtual screening:\n",
    "    - The main goal of DD methodology is to reduce an ultralarge docking database of billions of entries to a manageable few- million-molecules subset which yet encompasses the vast majority of virtual hits\n",
    "    - This final molecular subset can then be normally docked into the target using one or several docking programs or can be postprocessed with other VS means.\n",
    "    - DD itself is not a docking engine, but a DL score predictor to be used in conjunction with any docking program to rapidly eliminate a priori unfavorable, “undockable” molecular entities, and therefore drastically increase the speed of actual docking.\n",
    "    - The majority of nonhits were removed during the first iteration for all targets, while fewer molecules were discarded in successive steps, as expected due to larger portions of unfavorable compounds being present at the beginning of the runs. It was observed that the decrease rate and the number of hits identified were target-dependent\n",
    "- Analysis of DD performance\n",
    "    - all underlying DL models were generalizable in a consistent way\n",
    "    - there were FDRE scores comparisons done and enrichment values evaluated for top 10, 100 and 1000.\n",
    "    - true hits are highly concentrated at the top of the DD rank\n",
    "    - Overall, the above analysis indicates that the DD procedure can effectively discard most of unqualified molecules in a ultra large docking database, without losing more than a predefined percentage of virtual hits. In our opinion, this makes DD methodology an efficient mean for conducting large-scale VS campaigns involving billions of small molecule structures, and a valid alternative to brute force approaches demanding large amounts of computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "- These models then enable approximation of the docking outcome for unprocessed database entries. Importantly, DL allows the use of simple 2D protein-independent descriptors such as Morgan finger- prints to capture the docking scores. We have demonstrated that such approach can yield a manageably small subset of a database, highly enriched with favorably “dockable” molecular structures.\n",
    "- Moreover, DD appears to enrich final subsets with active ligands, even when only small portions of top ranked molecules are considered. This unexpected result suggests that true binders carry on certain chemical features that are complementary to the binding pocket and that the model is able to capture such features through the QSAR descriptors."

    "- Docking is not just computationally demanding, but also a remarkably wasteful process in which a very small subset of top-scoring compounds is considered for experimental evaluation. Thus, most docked molecules are simply discarded\n",
    "- DD, a technique that iteratively trains deep neural networks (DNNs) with small batches of explicitly docked com- pounds to infer the ranking of the yet-unprocessed remainder of the library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental design\n",
    "### Preparation of chemical libraries\n",
    "- most used ultra-large chemical libraries are ZINC15, ZINC20 and 'make-on-demand' Enamine\n",
    "- Morgan fingerprints with radius 2 and size of 1,024 bits - these extended-connectivity fingerprints represent a machine-readable description of molecules based on a fixed-length binary bit vector encoding the presence or absence of specific substructures \n",
    "\n",
    "### Receptor preparation\n",
    "- Target structures need to be prepared before the docking grids can be generated.\n",
    "- Non-structural water, lipids and solvent molecules are usually removed; the target protein may require structural optimization to repair any missing parts, add hydrogens, compute correct protonation states of residues and energetically relax the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Molecular sample size\n",
    "- Validation, test and initial training sets are randomly sampled from the entire docking library at the first DD pass.\n",
    "- From the second iteration on, the training set is iteratively augmented with random batches of molecules classified as virtual hits in the inference stage of the previous iteration\n",
    "- For library in order of billion compounds, recommended size of validation and test sets in the first iteration as large as possible, ideally comprising 1 million molecules each, and absolutely avoiding using less than 250,000 molecules \n",
    "- The size of the training set, on the other hand, influences mainly model precision, and performances improve with larger training sets (700,000–1,000,000 molecules) and more iterations (8–11).\n",
    "- Validation and test sets are generated only in the first iteration. Because the score threshold used to define virtual hits is decreased at each DD iteration, using small-sized sets can cause generalization issues, especially in the last iteration, in which the number of positive samples in the two sets is very limited (e.g., 0.01%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model training and inference\n",
    "- Each iteration step in the DD protocol encompasses model training and inference. To identify virtual hits, the protocol uses binary classifiers in the form of feedforward DNN models (multilayer per- ceptrons) trained on 1,024-bit circular Morgan fingerprints. \n",
    "- Binary ‘positive samples’ in training, validation and test sets are virtual hits with scores above a threshold, corresponding to a predefined top percentage of the docking-ranked molecules in the validation set. The rest of the molecules are labeled as ‘negative samples\n",
    "- After the binary labels are generated, a user-specified number of models with different combi- nations of hyperparameters (number of hidden layers and neurons, dropout frequencies, over- sampling of minority class and class weights) are trained to optimize model test set accuracy by using a grid search strategy\n",
    "- After the training phase is finished for the initial iteration, the optimal binary classifier is used for inference of virtual hit-likeness of the remainder of the molecular library. For the next iterations, training, validation and test sets are augmented with new compounds randomly selected from molecules with predicted virtual hit-likenesses higher than a classification threshold corresponding to a user-defined recall value for validation predictions.\n",
    "- The total number of iterations typically ranges from 4 to 11, and we normally train 24 models at each iteration in the optimization step. For most docking campaigns, these parameters are sufficient to shrink a database of 1–1.5 billion molecules to a few million compounds that could be conventionally docked with regular computa- tional resources. Alternatively, as we mentioned before, the preset recall value could be adjusted for more ‘aggressive’ DD-selection of top-scored compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- The DD protocol can be used in conjunction with any popular docking program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with alternative methods\n",
    "- One of the major challenges of modern CADD is a constantly growing need for computational resources required to screen chemical libraries that are exploding in size because of recent advances in automated synthesis and robotics.\n",
    "- OpenEye GigaDocking\n",
    "- Autodock program has been parallelized for Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)45 and deployed on the Summit supercomputer\n",
    "- VirtualFlow\n",
    "- Bender et al. developed a guide for ultra-large docking campaigns\n",
    "- These docking platforms achieved great high-throughput but are extremely resource demanding in comparison to DD.\n",
    "- Conventional docking of ultra-large libraries remains unaffordable for most of the research community\n",
    "- Hence many new machine learning emulation techniques developed\n",
    "- DD is one of the fastest AI-enabled docking platforms and the only method that has been extensively tested on 1B+ libraries. In addition, the DD protocol does not rely on a particular docking program, and thus it is compatible with the emerging large-scale docking methods to improve their high-throughput capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- DD is implemented for fast and economical virtual screening and thus provides docking details exclusively for the top-scoring molecules and disregards large fractions of chemical libraries.\n",
    "-  In addition, the quality of DD results entirely depends on the suitability of the docking program to prioritize active molecules from an ultra-large library. Hence, we anticipated that it would be challenging to discover active molecules from DD of a library of a billion molecules if docking performs poorly on the specific target, just like in the case of conventional docking\n",
