# The Open-source deep docking protocol

This **open-source optimized deep docking pipeline** is built upon an original Deep Docking pipeline created by Gentile et al. ([protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00659-2)).

To see instructions on how to run the protocol, please refer to the **Open-Source Deep Docking jupyter notebook** provided in this repository. 

The instructions are adjusted to use on specific cluster provided by the University of Cambridge, however, can be easily changed to work on any platform.
